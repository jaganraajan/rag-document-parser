# Data Directory

This directory contains persistent data files for the hybrid retrieval system:

- `vocab.json` - Vocabulary mapping from tokens to integer IDs for sparse vectors
- `df.json` - Document frequencies for each token used in TF-IDF calculations

These files are automatically created and maintained by the sparse storage system.
