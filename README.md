# RAG Document Parser

## Project Description
RAG Document Parser is a tool designed to parse and process documents efficiently using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. It supports various document formats and provides structured outputs for downstream applications. The tool is modular and can be extended to include advanced features for enhanced functionality.

## Installation
To install the project dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Here is an example of how to use the RAG Document Parser:
```python
from rag_document_parser import DocumentParser

parser = DocumentParser()
result = parser.parse("path/to/document.pdf")
print(result)
```

## Extending the Project
The RAG Document Parser can be extended with the following features:

### 1. Reranking with Cross-Encoder
Enhance the retrieval process by adding a reranking step using a cross-encoder. After retrieving the initial `top_k` documents, use a cross-encoder model to rerank the results based on relevance.

### 2. Hybrid Retrieval
Combine classical and dense retrieval methods by storing text in a classical index (e.g., Elasticsearch) while also leveraging dense embeddings. This hybrid approach improves retrieval accuracy and robustness.

### 3. Generation Layer with Prompt Templates
Incorporate a generation layer using a Large Language Model (LLM). Use prompt templates that reference retrieved chunks to generate coherent and contextually relevant outputs.
